            Many of us listen to music on the way to school, work, or to the mall. Whether it be through a radio, speaker, or smartphone music has become a major part in most people's lives without them even realizing.

            Most trends, phrases, and dances are popularized through the art of music. Even though music is such a widespread art in modern society, there are still many boundaries and intricacies that make the music industry more complex than we may think but to understand these we must first define our environment. 
        </p>
        <h2>Who makes up the music industry?</h2>
        <p>
            Artists, Song-Writers, Producers, Managers, A&Rs, Music Labels, Agents, Publicists, and Lawyers. In other words, music involves an entire team, despite how few people are usually shown in the limelight.
        </p>
        <h2>Who makes the rules?</h2>
        <p>
            Although there are certain contracts and hierarchical structures, ultimately, most norms in the music industry are set by the market, aka the listeners. Since the music industry involves such a large team of people, it tends to “follow the money”. This can easily be seen in past decades with 90’s hip hop, 80’s EDM, and 70’s disco and funk. The music industry follows the market, shifts in the genres and music styles preferred by the general public often determine the type of music which is most visible and promoted. Furthermore, the fans of artists often determine the perception that the artist may put forth. Lately, we’ve seen an emergence of big artists such as Saweetie, Lil Nas X, and Doja Cat being more accessible to their fans on popular social media apps. This is adhering to their fan base, and engaging in the places their fans find most important. We, as listeners, have much more power than we may realize.
        </p>
        <h2>Boundaries</h2>
        <p>
            I’m sure we’d like to think that we have all the power, but this isn’t the complete truth. Even though the market holds most of the power, this does not negate the influence of the power structures within the industry which are often used to gatekeeper, blackball, or control artists.
            Although most people don't pay attention to the tunes they often hear through their many electrical devices, they still play an important part in our lives and culture. This website will showcase and highlight artists and their music who significantly push boundaries as music artists and music moguls, as well as uncover the unfortunate stories of those affected by the music industry's toxic power structures.
